# Explanation
# Commented texts are not interpreted by the script.
# The ; symbol is a separator.
# If an element (condition, order or limitation) is empty (nothing or "" or '')
# then it isnot included in the query
# To get an value auto-incremented, just write NULL
# A SQL function can be used as a value
#
# Below are the models :
# SELECT;tablename;condition;columns;`column` ASC|DESC;limitation
# INSERT;tablename;values;
# UPDATE;tablename;condition;new values;limitation
# DELETE;tablename;condition;limitation
#
# Below are some examples :
# SELECT;Person;Age=25;id,FirstName,LastName,Age;`LastName` ASC;10
# => Display the id,first name and last name of 10 entries from the table "Person"
#    aged 25 asciently ordened by their last name.
#
# UPDATE;Article;Reference="0007452012";Manufacturer="Toys are freedom",Category="Cards";1
